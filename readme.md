# NodeBreaker

A chrome extension which reads twitch.tv chat for specific input.  It then runs game server commands based on the input received.

Commands are launch via the web based server console, due to protection within framework of the site - we bypass it by creating a button and simulating an on click event.

Made for use on NodeCraft Servers - in theory with modification this will work for any game they are able to host with a console but this example is based on MineCraft (any version).

### Not NodeJS - sorry!
